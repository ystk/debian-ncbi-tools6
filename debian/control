Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Depends: ncbi-data (= ${source:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Multi-Arch: same
Description: NCBI libraries for biology applications
 The NCBI Software Development Toolkit was developed for the production and
 distribution of GenBank, Entrez, BLAST, and related services by NCBI.  It
 allows you to read and write NCBI ASN.1 files, builds Blast or Entrez, etc.

Description: NCBI libraries for biology applications (development files)
 This package supplies development versions of NCBI's non-graphical C
 libraries, along with the corresponding header files.

Package: libncbi6-dbg
Architecture: any
Section: debug
Priority: extra
Depends: libncbi6 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}

Multi-Arch: same
Description: NCBI libraries for biology applications (debugging symbols)
 This package is useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a
 debugger; this facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding
 logic errors in programs using the libraries in this package (or the
 libraries themselves).
 .
 Non-programmers will likely have little use for this package.  See the
 libncbi6 package for more information.

Description: Platform-independent data for the NCBI toolkit
 This package contains support files needed by the NCBI toolkit on all
 platforms.

Description: large rRNA BLAST databases distributed with the NCBI toolkit
 This package contains some ribosomal RNA BLAST databases distributed
 as part of the NCBI C Toolkit that are too large and specialized to
 include in ncbi-data.  Specifically, it contains the databases
 Combined16SrRNA_2-12-2008, LSURef_93.fasta, and SSURef_93.fasta,
 along with an alias file to facilitate searching all three of them in
 conjunction with the 16SCore database included in ncbi-data.

Description: NCBI libraries for biology applications (text-based utilities)
 This package includes various utilities distributed with the NCBI C SDK,
 including the development tools asntool and errhdr (formerly of
 libncbi6-dev).  None of the programs in this package require X; you can
 find the X-based utilities in the ncbi-tools-x11 package.  BLAST and
 related tools are in a separate package (blast2).

Description: NCBI libraries for biology applications (X-based utilities)
 This package includes some X-based utilities distributed with the
 NCBI C SDK: Cn3D, Network Entrez, Sequin, ddv, and udv.  These
 programs are not part of ncbi-tools-bin because they depend on
 several additional library packages.

Multi-Arch: foreign
Description: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
 The famous sequence alignment program. This is "official" NCBI version,
 #2. The blastall executable allows you to give a nucleotide or protein
 sequence to the program. It is compared against databases and a summary of
 matches is returned to the user.
 .
 Note that databases are not included in Debian; they must be retrieved
 manually.

Description: NCBI libraries for graphic biology applications
 This is the library for those who just want to run Vibrant applications.
 It also includes a wrapper (vibrate) that allows many NCBI applications to
 provide a GUI for selecting options.
