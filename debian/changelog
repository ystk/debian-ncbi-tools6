  * vibrant/vib{main,wndws.c}: restore sane behavior in key corner cases

  * Drop transitional packages, which are now entirely redundant thanks to

  * Migrate to lesstif2, renaming libvibrant6(-dbg) to libvibrant6a(-dbg)
    to avoid any possibility of version skew.  [Lesstif lacks versioned
    symbols, though admittedly so does Vibrant.]  (Closes: #374233.)
  * Make debian/stamp-setup a dependency of common-configure-indep as well
    as common-configure-arch so that building via an immediate call to
    "fakeroot debian/rules binary" works properly, per #373971.
  * Explicitly build depend on modular versions of *all* relevant X
    libraries, per the other issue in #373971 (and to ensure that the arm
    autobuilder's failure mode *really* can't recur).

    we *can* actually drop -I/usr/X11R6/include and -L/usr/X11R6/lib,
    avoiding the failure mode observed on the arm autobuilder.
  * Further increase cdbs's minimum required version to the brand new
    0.4.40, which automatically sets DEB_DBG_PACKAGE_* appropriately.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20060507-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rework inter-package relationships with the help of dpkg-dev 1.13.19.
  * Migrate remaining shared library support files (including vibrate) to
    ncbi-data, as they're conveniently all architecture-independent.
  * Add cleanasn (new) to the list of applications to build, and give it a
    man page.
  * Update existing man pages.
  * Increase the cdbs requirement to 0.4.39-0.1, and drop workarounds for
    (some?) older versions.
  * Switch to debhelper compatibility level 5, with its reworked -dbg
    package handling.
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.2.

    the alternate [build-]dependencies on virtual packages, of course).
  * Add insdseqget to the list of applications to build.
  * Stop installing wwwblast.h, which is private to code we don't even
    build.
  * Update man pages (and add one for insdseqget, forked from gbseqget's).

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20051206-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Temporarily switch to pmake (added to Build-Depends) for upstream's
    makefiles, as GNU make 3.81.b4 gets mysteriously confused when trying
    to build from them (but, oddly, only when invoked from debian/rules).
  * Add "new" blastall_old executable to the blast2 package.
  * Reshuffle documents slightly, and make sure to register all top-level
    HTML documents with doc-base.

    NMUs.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20050828-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Adds two new programs: sbtedit (in ncbi-tools-x11) and trna2sap
      (in ncbi-tools-bin).  
  * Drop obsolete alternative (build-)dependencies on ancient versions of
    xlibs-dev, and silly build-dependency on libglu1-xorg | libglu1c2, and
    resync libvibrant-dev's dependencies properly.
  * Add man pages for the new programs, and clean up and update others as
    needed.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20050605-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Enable asn2asn via VIB rather than unnecessarily modifying
    makedemo.unx, and add (and document) nps2gps and trna2tbl along
    the way.
  * Make sure to build with libglu1c2 for the C++ transition.
  * Don't set DEB_DH_SHLIBDEPS_ARGS; it's not necessary with current
    versions of dpkg and cdbs, and -L isn't actually additive anyway.
  * Bump standards-version to 3.6.2 (no changes needed).

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20050429-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Add and document asn2all, asn2fsa, asnval, and gene2xml, even though

  * Make Nentrez and Psequin available under the saner names entrez and
    sequin.
  * Tweak debian/rules to better handle "draft" builds from subversion.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20041020-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix FTBFS under GCC 4.0 caused by inconsistent use of "static" on
    functions.  (Closes: #295110.)
  * Add a watch file, now that we can.  (Upstream's layout needs version=3.)

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20040616-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/blast2.docs: adjusted for new arrangement (a separate
    source-tree directory full of HTML files).
  * debian/{control,lib*-dbg.install,rules}: switch to new-style -dbg
    packages containing just the stripped-out symbols.
  * debian/{installman,ncbi-tools-bin.install,rules}: upstream has dropped
    f(asta)merge.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20040505-1) unstable; urgency=low

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20040204-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update X-related (build-)dependencies per the changes in 4.3.
  * Reunite the Vibrant packages, with libvibrant.so.6 and
    libncbicn3d.so.6 always pointing at the OpenGL-enabled versions, now
    that xlibmesa-gl merely suggests the heavyweight packages containing
    acceleration modules.
  * As such, tighten shlibdeps for libvibrant6 to avoid possible trouble.

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/copyright: expand public domain notice to full length.
  * debian/*.install: install newly added files.
  * debian/rules:
    - supply appropriate -L args to dh_shlibdeps (accidentally lost when
      converting to CDBS).
    - various minor cleanups.
  * demo/debruijn.c: fix fencepost error.
  * desktop/bspview.c, vibrant/netscape.c: launch sensible-browser rather
    than netscape.
  * doc/man/blast.1: document new blast2 executable.
  * doc/man/debruijn.1: new, based on help output.
  * make/makeshlb.unx: add dependency info for libblast(api).

  * debian/blast2.docs: follow README.* -> *.txt renaming.
  * debian/libncbi6-dev.install: add new headers scoremat.h and wwwblast.h.
  * debian/installman: new; factored out of debian/rules, and enhanced
    to look in doc/man before debian/man and tweak pages as needed.
  * debian/instdoc: removed (not used since conversion to CDBS).
  * debian/man/*: remove pages now committed upstream.
  * debian/{ncbi-tools-bin.files,rules}: remove cdscan (obsolete).
  * debian/rules: run new debian/installman script.
  * debian/vibrant/vibwndws.c: add a weak declaration of Nlm_Main
    (and code to complain if it's not satisfied) here too.

    unstripped libraries from /usr/lib/ncbi-tools-dbg to /usr/lib/debug.

    - Bump CDBS build-dependency to >= 0.4.12.
    - Drop redundant entries from build-depends-indep.
  * debian/libncbi6.doc-base: Actually supply the documentation
    directory's current name.  (Closes: #215398.)
  * debian/rules: Take advantage of CDBS 0.4.12's support for -dbg packages.
  * corelib/ncbimain.c: Use an __attribute__((weak)) declaration for
    Nlm_Main rather than a dummy implementation + #pragma weak.
  * vibrant/shim3d.c: Likewise for Cn3D_GetCurrentOGLData.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20030421-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.6.1 (no changes needed).
    - blast2, ncbi-tools-bin: Suggest libvibrant6 rather than vibrant6.
    - libvibrant6-gl{,-dev}, ncbi-tools-x11: lower priority to extra due
      to conflicts with libvibrant6-nogl, which is optional.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20030421-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "overdue cleanup" release.
  * general (debian/*, make/makeshlb.unx):
    - Rename library packages to start with "lib"; ncbi-tools6 and vibrant6
      are now dummy forwarding packages.
    - Move libvibgif.so.6 to libncbi6, since it's independent of X.
    - Split GL and non-GL variants of libvibrant and libncbicn3d into
      separate packages.
    - Standardize on the network version of the Entrez 1 access library
      (libncbiNacc), if only for the sake of other libraries that need any
      of the three variants; the CDROM-only version's not so useful
      nowadays, and the combo version seems to misfire without the CDs.
      Note that all three remain available in static form.
    - Handle the circular relationship between libncbiNacc and libnetentr by
      linking the PIC version of libnetentr.a into libncbiNacc.so and making
      libnetentr.so.6 merely another link to libncbiNacc.so.6. (Kludge.)
    - Set up proper shared library dependencies, now that it is possible to
      do so uniquely.
    - Now compliant with Policy 3.6.0.
  * connect/ncbi_http_connector.c: Don't half-close sockets after sending
    headers, as we can't always successfully read from them afterwards
    (due to broken firewalls?).
  * debian/rules:
    - Switch to CDBS, despite upstream's funky build system.
    - Stop imposing the obsolete menu icon color restriction.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20030421-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * api/aliread.c: avoid char vs. EOF comparisons.
  * debian/{blast2,ncbi-tools6-dev}.docs: package new upstream docs.
  * debian/control:
    - Change section to devel.
    - Bump standards version to 3.5.9 (already compliant).
    - Change preferred libpng-dev to libpng12-dev (12-0-dev went away).
  * debian/man/Psequin.1: sequin seems to take options after all;
    (very roughly) document them.
  * debian/man/{asn2gb,blast,fastacmd,gbseqget,gil2bin,tbl2asn}.1:
    - Update to reflect current help output.
  * debian/rules: add bl2seq to VIB so we still actually build it.
  * demo/gil2bin.c: #include <blast.h> for GetGisFromFile prototype.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20021213-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oops, add a dependency on xlibmesa-gl-dev|libgl-dev because
    xlibmesa-glu-dev doesn't seem to depend on it....
  * Likewise for xlibmesa3-glu | libglu1, due to #178310.
  * Still no (intentional) changes in actual content relative to
    6.1.20021213-2.

  * Update OpenGL deps to xlibmesa-glu-dev|libglu-dev.
  * Hack debian/rules to give blast2 a more meaningful version number.
  * Finally rename *.files to *.install and change dh_movefiles -a to
    dh_install -a --autodest --list-missing --sourcedir=debian/tmp.  (Drop
    ncbi-data.files in favor of installing directly into debian/ncbi-data.)
  * Add lintian overrides for menu-icon-missing warnings.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20021213-2) unstable; urgency=low

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20021213-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  (Man pages updated.)
  * Change preferred libpng-dev to libpng12-0-dev rather than libpng3-dev
    (which is a dummy package these days).
  * Abandon plans for switching to lesstif2, as Vibrant seems to work
    better with lesstif1.

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Dec 2002 22:34:26 -0500

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20021119-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  (Man pages updated accordingly.)
  * Update for policy 3.5.8: move menu entries to Apps/Science per #162812.
  * Indicate options in man pages with \- rather than - per #159872.
  * Move icons from /usr/X11R6/include/X11/pixmaps to /usr/share/pixmaps.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20020828-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Update man pages based on current help output.
  * Go to standards version 3.5.7 (support "noopt" rather than "debug" in
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS).
  * Strictly speaking, the ABI changes should necessitate a new soname,
    but no external Debian packages seem to use the affected interfaces,
    so I'll be lazy.  You may need to rebuild any local binaries you have.
    (Conflict with old versions of our binary packages, though.)

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20020426-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Partially migrate to debhelper v4.
  * Pave the way for C++ toolkit packages (in progress):
    - Provide a weak default definition of Nlm_Main so that our shared
      libncbi doesn't bite applications which supply their own main().
    - Rename Cn3D to Cn3D-3.0 and register it as an alternative for Cn3D.
  * Move to libpng3 (only affects applications).
  * Rename fmerge to fastamerge to resolve conflict with fhist.
    (Closes: #155791)

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20020426-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enable large-file support; please let me know if this turns out to
    break anything.  (Closes: #144531)
  * Don't build ncbithr.o or link against -lpthread unless that library
    actually exists; should help on non-Linux ports.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20020426-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release; apparently fixes formatdb segfault on PowerPC
    (closes: #144783).
  * Some existing interfaces have changed, but not enough to justify
    bumping the soname; if binaries built against older revisions of the
    toolkit no longer work, try rebuilding them.  (I don't believe this
    affects any other Debian packages.)
  * Updated man pages based on current help output.
  * Patched both versions (regular and Vibrant) of common argument-
    processing code to honor "--help" (closes: #144785).

  * Deal with some 64-bit-cleanliness issues.
  * Partially fix Cn3D lossage in #127224.  (It still crashes, but later.)
  * Fix copymat lossage with trailing spaces and improve its error
    messages (closes: #138933).
  * Split architecture-independent files into new ncbi-data package.
  * Fix path to libXm.so.1 in vibrate.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20011220-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #126625).
  * Bug #31724 is probably fixed by now, and too vague to do much of
    anything with anyway.  (Closes: #31724; please supply useful details
    if reopening.)
  * Tweak rules so that the shlibs dependency is always

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20010709-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Menu seems to be broken on some architectures, so drop build
    dependency and add a copy of cmap.xpm to debian/.
  * Slightly rework treatment of icons in debian/rules.
  * Change "c-shell" to "tcsh|c-shell" in build-deps to address buildd
    warnings.
  * Add lintian overrides for new menu file.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20010709-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change priority of debugging libraries to extra, per the override file.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20010709-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sigh, the change in -4 intended to fix arm broke it instead; revert to
    __arm__.  Where'd I put that paper bag? ;-)
  * Allow #cpu(...) and #machine(...) for all platforms.
  * Downgrade "unknown platform" to a warning; the code mostly doesn't
    care which PROC_XXX macro, if any, gets defined (and when it does, may
    read too much from it; see below).
  * Fix uses of PROC_XXX not to assume that MIPS -> IRIX or HPPA -> HP/UX.
  * Use appropriate sysconf to get processor count.

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Oct 2001 13:26:49 -0400

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20010709-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Also fix test for m68k.  Why can't the macros be more consistent?
  * Check everything else against the GCC sources and find that __arm__
    should be arm.
  * That should be all of these; apologies for the inconvenience.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20010709-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix problems caught by autobuilders:
  * Rewrite clean rule to avoid mkdir. (Closes: #115103)
  * Add build-dependency on c-shell (ugh) for ln-if-absent.
  *
  * Whoops, my previous sweep missed two (old, minor) bugs on
    ncbi-tools6-dev:
  * 31724: I suspect I can close this by now, but don't have a whole lot
    of information to go on; could somebody on an Alpha investigate?
  * 38354: Debugging libraries would be a good idea, but I'm holding off
    until autobuilds succeed because adding more binary packages
    introduces ftpmaster wait.
  *
  * Keep shlib requirement at >= 6.1.20010709-1, because this version
    doesn't change anything relevant.
  * Add HTTP URL for HTML SDK docs.
  * Optimize out blast.REAL build.

ncbi-tools6 (6.1.20010709-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version; adds more apps, and includes newer BLAST (2.2.1
    rather than 2.0.9).  (Closes: #33451, #37966, #37967, #47369, #101168)
  * Repackaged largely from scratch, acknowledging the convoluted nature
    of the upstream build system.
  * Put ncbi-tools6 and vibrant6 in section "libs", where they belong,
    rather than "devel" (already correct in override file).
  * Used the same form of my name in the control file and the changelog so
    that katie doesn't think I'm making NMUs.
  * Acknowledged my own last "NMU"  (Closes: #100247, #103550, #104365)
  * Enabled thread support for appropriate applications.  (Closes: #35216)
  * Added automatic fallback to /etc/ncbi if NCBI not set in the
    environment; did away with no-longer-necessary wrappers.
  * New binary packages for apps: ncbi-tools-bin and ncbi-tools-x11.
  * Moved data to /usr/share/ncbi/data, since it's architecture-independent.
  * Closes all existing bugs.  Let's see how long that lasts...
    and no fair filing silly reports just to thwart me. ;-)
  * Dropped text version of old SDK docs in favor of pointer to online HTML
    version.
  * Don't link against Vibrant unnecessarily; instead, provide a wrapper
    script (vibrate) with the same net effect.
  * Added menu entries (using vibrate for apps it benefits).
  * Added Lintian overrides to deal with cross-package menu entries.
  * Registered with doc-base.
  * Clean by Lintian 1.20.15, modulo the aforementioned overrides.

ncbi-tools6 (6.0.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adopted. (Closes: #100247)
  * Acknowledge previous NMUs.  (Closes: #103550, #104365)
  * Stop installing /usr/share/doc/ncbi-tools6/NCBI/fa2htgs/updateHtgsDoc;
    it was causing a Lintian error (executable file under /usr/share/doc)
    and not useful as-is anyway (referring to paths only valid on NCBI
    systems).
  * Honor DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, and build without -g by default.
  * Above change should suffice to bump standards version to 3.5.6.  Yay!
  * Now clean by Lintian 1.20.14.1.

ncbi-tools6 (6.0.2-2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * The previous maintainer has resigned.  Setting maintainer to Debian QA
    Group <packages@qa.debian.org>.
  * debian/ncbi-tools6-dev.README.debian: add final newline to shut diff up
  * debian/control: tidied up package descriptions
  * debian/rules: use dh_shlibdeps -l instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  * debian/{shlibs,vibrant6.shlibs}: while we're at it, why don't we have
    some shlibs files to go with these shared library packages, like they
    taught us in freshman year at Debian University
  * Thanks to the above two fixes... (Closes: #104365)

  * Removed self-conflict of vibrant-dev; closes: #49712
  * Changed the double installation of the copyright file by ncbi-tools6 and

    /usr/share/doc/ncbi-tools6-dev); closes: #51122, #77541, #56643
  * Added the installation of README.blast.
  * Updated to newer standards version and added Build-Depends.
  * Added debhelper token to vibrant6.preinst to fix lintian warning.
  * Moved blast2 from section misc to science, because it is a tool that
    is exclusively useful for molecular biologists.
